# Basic Commands

## Paths

`/usr/share/dict/words` is an absolute path

> **Relative Path**: a path relative to the current directory

Example:

If your current directory is `/usr/share` then `/usr/share/dict/words` is equivalent to `dict/words`

When shell sees a relative path, it concatenates the relative path to the current path.

`.` refers to the current directory

`..` refers to the parent

`../..` refers to grandparent

## Listing

`ls` - Listing

```
$ ls -a

//list all files
```

`pwd` - present working directory

`~` - short form for the user's home directorys

```
$ cd /usr/share/dict
  ^         ^
command    argument
```
---
## Concatenation

`cat` - concatenate

`ctrl - c` - kills the program
`ctrl - d` - signals end of file
<br>

`cat infile`
* cat is given "infile" ad command line arg
* **cat** OPENS the file

vs

`cat < infile`
* shell opens infile and gives contents to cat as if it came from an input stream

```
$ cat < input.txt
```
> repeats the contents of input.text

while

```
$ cat > output.txt
```
> writes the output of cat to txt

` cat > ` replaces while ` cat >>` appends

**General form:**

```
command < input.txt > output.txt
```

*input goes from input.txt to command, and this is written to output*


```
$ wc sample.txt

will return

35 278 1494 sample.txt
```

while

```
$ wc < sample.txt

will return

35 278 1494
```

In the first example wc will read the file, while in the second example wc will be supplied the contents of sample.txt

---
### Globbing

```
*.txt
```

creates a "globbing" expression or pattern

```
$ ls *.txt
```

will return all .txt Files

> "*" matches 0 or more characters

Use "" or '' or \ to suppress globbing patterns

---

### Manuals

Many commands allow I/O redirection and/or arguments, but not all

Easy awy to tell is to open up manual pages eg: `$ man cat` or `$ man ls`

---

### I/O stream

`std in` stands for standard input

`std in => [program] => std out & std err`

by default you recieve both `std out` and `std err`

You can isolate for `std out` by using `>` or `1>`

You can isolate for `std err` by using `2>`

* `std out` is buffered, whole output stream is dumped at once
* `std err` is not buffered, output is dumped char by character

This separation allows you to separate "regular" output from any error messages you may encounter

Eg: ```./myprogram args < infile > outfile 2> errors```

---

### Pipes

"|" pipes output (std out) from previous command and send it as a standard input

eg. `cat infile | sort | wc -l | cut -f1 -2 -d ':'`

Allows us to take a file sort it count the lines in the file using the delimiter ':'
