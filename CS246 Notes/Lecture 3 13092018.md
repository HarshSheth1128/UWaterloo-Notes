echo "Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)"
```

```
echo 'Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)'
```

```
Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)
```

The "|" symbol is used as the "or" Operator

```
(c|C)(s|S)246 returns
```
returns us all of: Cs246 cS246 cs246 CS246

[^abs] - any character not from this separate

? - 0 or 1 occurences of the preceeding expression

'*' - 0 or more occurences of the preceeding expression

`(cs)*246` will return 246 cs246 cscs246 cscscs246

`+` - 1 or more occurences of the preceeding

`.` - any one character

`.*` - any number of character

Use `^` to force matches to behin with the pattern use <br>
`^cs.*cs246` - matches lines that start with cs

Use `$` ot force that the line must end with this pattern <br>
`^cs.*246$` - line must start with cs and end with 246

## Examples

**Fetch lines of even length**

```
egrep '^(..)*$'

psudo: match only in pairs
```

**Files in the current directory whose name contains exactly one a**

```
ls | egrep '^[^a]*a[^a]*$'

pseudo: match not a, then a, then not a
```

# File Permission

```
ls -l    - long Listing
```

returns

```
-rw-r--r-x 1 nanaeem staff 28 Date abc.text
|   |     |   |      |    |    |    ^ refers to filename
|   |     |   |      |    |    ^ last modified
|   |     |   |      |     ^ size
|   |     |   |      ^ group
|   |     |    ^ owner
|   |     ^ amount of shorcuts linking to this files
|   ^permission bits
^ type of file
```

permission bits are in groups of 3 for owner, group, other respectively

Permission bits can be either
- r: read
- w: write
- x: execute
  - for directory: it means to enter,
  - for file: implies you can run the file

Changing gile permissions
- only the owner can

`command: chmod mode file(s)`

mode:

ownership class
u - user bits
g - group bits
o - other bits
a- all bits

- Give others read access: `o+r`

- Remove execute:

- Set all permissions to read `a=r`
