# Lecture 22: Exceptions Safety

Last time
```c++
void f(){
    MyClass *p = new MyClass
    MyClass m;
    g()
    delete p; //if g throws an error than we leak p
}
```

Want out program to recover from exceptions
- Program to not leak memory
- Want to stay in a consistent state
    - no dangling ptrs
    - no broken invariants

C++ guarantee: during stack unwinding all stack allocated objects are destroyed
 - dtors run, memory reclaimed

Refactor f
```c++
void f(){
    MyClass *p = new MyClass;
    try{
        MyClass m;
        g();
    } catch(...){
        delete p;
        throw;
    }
    delete p;
}
```

We want a way to guarantee that some code runs irrespective of whether an exception occurs or not

Java -> `finally` clause
Scheme -> `dynamic wind`
C++ -> nothing

In C++ we need to rely on the guarantee for stark objects
- maximize stack usage

C++ idiom: RAII: resource acquisition is initialization
- ever resource should be wrapped within a stack allocated object whose dtor releases the resource

example
```c++
ifstream f{"file.txt"};//automatically opens the file
```
the file resource is release (closed) when the stack object goes out of scope

## RAII for heap memory

Wrap the heap object within a stack object whose dtor deallocated the heap object.

STL provides a template class to to do this

```c++
std::unique-ptr<T>
```
- ctor stakes a T* as an argument
- dtor deletes the pointer
- overloads operator*, operator->


```c++
void f(){
    std::unique-ptr<MyClass> p {new MyClass};
    // or we can do 
    auto p = std::make_unique<MyClass>(//constructor params);
    MyClass m;
    g();
}
```

Destructor for p calls MyClass's destructor
We can use bp as if it was a pointer of MyClass

## Copying vs Moving unique ptrs
```c++
class C{...};
auto p = make-unique<c>();

unique_ptr<c> q = p; // won't compile
```
- unique-ptr does not have a copy ctor, it is disabled because we would get double frees.
- We would have multiple stack objects pointing to the same heap object.

Sample implementation of unique.ptr
```
c++/uniqueptr/basicimpl.cc
```

- delete keyword to disable copying

## Ownership
- who owns the heap resource
- if code does not own the heap resource, it can be provided the "raw" pointer.
- use get() to access the raw ptr

If these are multiple owners, use std::shared_ptr

shared-ptr uses reference counting
- dtor only deleted heap memory when ref. count searches o.

## 3 Levels of exception safety
1. Basic guarantee: if an exception occurs the program is in a valid but unspecified state (no memory leaks, no dangling pointers)
2. Strong guarantee: if an exception occurs during f, it is as if f was never called
3. No-throw guarantee: f does not throw exceptions, achieves its task
