# Lecture 5: Testing, C++, Intro

#### Testing
- Testing is not the same as debugging
- Testing does not guarantee correctness
  - Can prove presence of defects

##### Writing Tests
- write small test cases
- check various classes of input
  - numeric ranges
    - postivie, negative, zero
  - boundaries between ranges (edge cases)
  - simultaneous boundaries (corner cases) ex. (0,0) (0,10) (10, 0), (10, 10)

## C++

#### Bjarne Stroustrup
- created linux
- based off of simula67 - first oo language
- created C with classes
- overtime was named to C++
- We use C++14

#### Hello world in C++
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  cout << "Hello World" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

##### Things to encounter
- We did not include stdio.h which provides printf
  - that would have been legal to use, it is just illegal for this course

Include iostream
```c++
Produce output :

std::cout << data1 << data2;
std::endl;
```
- by including `using namespace std` we can refer to cout without using the std::

#### Compiling c++ programs
```bash
$>  g++ -std=c++14 hello.cc -o myprog
    #or
$>  g++14 hello.cc
    #then
$>  ./myprog
```
- without -o default executable is a.out

### C++ I/O

including iostream given us access to 3 I/O variables

1. `std::cin`
  - Purpose: read from stdin
  - Use the input Operator >>
  - eg. std::cin >> x
2. `std::cout`
  - Purpose: write to stdout
  - Use the output operator <<
  - eg. std::cout << x
3. `std::cerr`
  - Purpose: write to stderr
  - Use the output operator
  - eg. std:: cerr << "ERROR"

#### Write two numbers
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x,y;
  cin >> x >> y;
  cout << x+y << endl;
}
```
- return 0 is assumed;
- cin will read from first non-whitespace character until it hits whitespace
  - whitepsace is being ignored
- if a read fails due to bad input type, variable was set to 0
- if a read fails because there is no more input (EOF), variable was set to 0
- if a read fails, the expression cin.fail() is true
- if the read fails due to EOF, both cin.fail() and cin.eof() are true

#### Read all ints from stdin and echo to stdout. Stop if a read fails.
(io/readInts.cc)

```c++
int main() {
  int i;
  while (true) {
    cin >> i;
    if (cin.fail()) break;
    cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```
##### Other ways

- C++ defines an automatic conversion from a istream type to booleans
- cin has type istream
- cin is true if the last read succeeded
- instead of writing cin.fail() we can use (!cin)

```c++
int main() {
  int i;
  while (true) {
    cin >> i;
    if (!cin) break;
    cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```

```c++
 x >> 3;
```
- the `>>` operater is called a bit shift.
- Int c++ `>>` is both the bit shift and input operator
- Having multiple behaviours for an operator is called operator overloading

**Operator Overloading**

```c++
cin >> i
```
- will produce cin
- input operator is a binary operator that is left associative
- `cin >> x >> y` cin is sent to x cin is sent to y

```c++
int main() {
  int i;
  while(true){
    if(!(cin>>i)) break;
    cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```

which can be condensed too

```c++
int main() {
  int i;
  while(cin >> i){
    cout << i << endl;
  }
}
```

#### Read all ints an echo them to stdout until eof, skip non-int input
```c++
int main(){
  int ;
  while (true) {
    if (cin >> i) cout << i endl;
    else {
      if (cin.eof()) break;
      else{
        //cin.fail() condition
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If one read fails, flag goes up and all subsequent reads fail. So we must ignore the flag.

```c++
int main(){
  int ;
  while (true) {
    if (cin >> i) cout << i endl;
    else {
      if (cin.eof()) break;
      else{
        cin.clean();
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- bad input is still in the stream, we have not discarded it, simply removed the flag

```c++
int main(){
  int ;
  while (true) {
    if (cin >> i) cout << i endl;
    else {
      if (cin.eof()) break;
      else{
        cin.clean();
        cin.ignore(); //ignores one character ex. hello ignores H
      }
    }
  }
}
```
