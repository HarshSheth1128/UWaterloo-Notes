## Function Overloading

```c++
 int negate (int x) {return -x;}
```

```c++
 int negate (bool x) {return !x;}
```

The compiler looks at the function name, number & types of parameters

Cannot just differ on return types

Operator overloading in an example of function overloading

```c++
cin >> x; //<= int

operator >> (cin x);

cin << y; //<= string
```

## Structs

```c++

Node {
  int data;
  Node *next;
};

Node n = {3, Null};
```
`nullptr` - represents the null pointer

## Constants

```c++
const int Max = 100;

const Node n1{5, nullptr};
// cannot change fields of n1

int x = 10;

const int *p = &x;  //the value pointed to is constant

int * const p1 = &x; //the pointer is constant

p1 = &y; //invalid

*p1 = 10; //valid
```

## Parameter Passing

Default: pass by value

```c++
void inc(int n){
   n = n+1;
};

int x = 5;
inc(x);
cout << x; //prints 5
```

Pass by pointer

```c++
void inc(int *n){
 *n = *n + 1;
}

int x = 5;
inc(&x);
cout << x; //prints 6
```

scanf("%s", &x);

cin >> x
operator >> (cin, x);

Why do we not write cin >> &x

C++ has a ptr-like typ ecalled a reference

## L Value reference
```c++
 int y = 10;
 int &z = y; // Z is an L value reference to y
```
An L value reference is a constant pointer with automatic dereferencing. Z will continue to "point" to y.

```c++
 z = 15 //no need to write * as it is automatically derefernced
```

z acts like y

```c++
int *p = &z; //p now points to y
```

Z has not identity of its own pointerness, it mimics y

sizeof(z) - gives size of y

---
**Things you cannot do with references**

- cannt leave them uninitialized

```c++
int &z; //False: must initialize with an L value
```

L value - something that can appear on the LHS of an assignment

- something that has a memory address

```c++
 int &x = 5; //False: cant initialize to non L value

 int &x = y + z; //False cannot create a pointer to a reference
```

Cannot create a reference to a reference;

Cannot create an array of references

We can pass by reference

```c++
void inc(int &n){
  n = n + 1;
}

int x = 5;
inc(x); // this does int &n = x (n is an alias for x)
cout << x; // prints 6
```

```c++
cin >> x

//why not

cin >> &x;
```
because x is passed by reference

```c++
std::istream &operator >> (std::istream &in, int &data) {

}
```

Param 2 - by reference
Param 1 - by reference
- because we cannot make copies of streams
- want changes to stream to be visible when function is done

need to return as
```c++
  (cin >> x) >> y
// ^
// |
// returns cin
```

```c++
struct ReallyBig { };

void f(ReallyBig rb){ }
//this will cause a copy to be created
//expensive

In c, we would pass a ptr to avoid this copy
In c++, w ecan also pass by reference

```

```c++
void g(ReallyBig &rb){ }
```

## Advice

Always prefer passing by reference to const

```c++
 void g (int&x) {
   g(5), x; //not allowed
   g(y + y); //not allowed
 }
```

```c++
 void f(const int &x){ }
 f(5);
 f(y+y);
```

## Dynamic Memory

```c++
 int *p = malloc(some size); //cannot use
 free(p); // cannot use

 struct Node{
   int data;
   Node *next;
 }

 //We now use

 Node *np = new Node;
 delete np;

 //For arrays

 int *arr = new int[10];
 delete [] arr;

   //[] for deallocating arrays
```
