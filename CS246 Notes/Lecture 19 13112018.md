# Lecture 19: Big 5 revisited, More design patterns

```c++
    class Book{
        //assume big 5 implemented
    };

    class Text: public Book {
        //assume no implementation of big 5
    };

    Text t1 {..., ..., ..., ...};

    Text t2 = t1;
    //calls for the free copy ctor for Text

    //Copy Ctor
    Text::Text(const Text &other):Book{other}, topic {other.topic}{}

    t1 = t2;

    //Copy Opertor
    Text &Text::operator=(const Text &other){
        Book::operator=(other);
        topic = other.topic;
        return *this;
    }

    //Move ctor
    Text::(Text &&other):Book{other},topic{other.topic}{}
    //This is incorrect
    //Book uses the copy ctor
    //Topic uses the copy ctor

```

```c++
int *p;
//p is a pointer
//p is an lvalue
```

```c++
Text &&other
//other is an rvalue reference
//other is an lvalue
```
We need a way to treat other as an r value despite it being an L value
- c++ std library provides the function std::move which allows treating lvalues as rvalues.    

Correct Implementation
```c++
//Move Ctor
Text::Text(Text &&other): Book{std::move(other)}, topic{std::move(other.topic)}{}

//Copy Operator
Text &Text::operator=(Text &&other){
    Book::operator=(std::move(other));
    topic = std::mvoe(other.topic);
    return *this;
}
```
---

```c++
Text t1{"abc", "Nomair", 400, "cs246"};
Text t2{"xyz", "Dave", 200, "CS136"};
Book *ptr1 = &t1;
Book *ptr2 = &t2;
*pt1 = *pt2;
```

Object assignment through base class ptrs.
- Book::operator= runs

## Partial assignment problem
We could make Book::operator = virtual

```c++
class Book{
    public:
    virtual Book &operator=(const Book&);
};

class Text: public Book {
    public:
    Text &operator=(const Text&) override;
    //Wrong we need to take in the same thing to override
    Text &operator=(const Book &) override;
};

```

## Mixed Assignment Problem
The assignment operator for Text will accept any type of Book.

- How would we even implment this? -- Later

Prevent partial assignment from happening
- don't let objects be assigned through base class ptrs
    - make Book::operator= private? NO
    - make Book::operator= protected? NO
        - Now Book objects cannot be assignment to other books

- Perhaps the base class should be abstract

```c++
Text t1{__}, t2{__};
AbstractBook *pt1{&t1};
AbstsactBook *pt2{&t2};
*pt1 = *pt2; //Will not compile
```

# Factory Method Pattern

//Game UML

Suppose we had a game

```c++
Player *p = ...;
Player *e = ...;
Enemy *e = nullptr;

while(p->notDead()){
    //generate enemy

    //attack player
}
```

```c++
class Level{
    public:
    virtual Enemy *createEnemy() = 0;
}

class Normal : public Level {
    public:
    Enemy *createEnemy()override{//more turtles}
}

class Castle : public Level {
    public:
    Enemy *createEnemy() override {//more bullets}
}
```

## Virtual Constructor Pattern
- delegating a method to act like a ctor

eg
- begin/end for Iterator
- addToFront

# Template Method Pattern
- Used in situations where base class wants some methods to not be overriden or some other to be overridable

//UML in diagrams

```c++
class Turtle{
    void drawHead(){...}
    void drawFeet(){...}
    virtual void drawShell()=0;
    public:
    void draw(){
        drawHead();
        drawShell();
        drawFeet();
    }
}
```
