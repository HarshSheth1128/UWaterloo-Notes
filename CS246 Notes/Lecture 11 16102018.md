```c++
Node::Node(const Node &other): data{other data}, next {others.next}{}

Node *n = new Node {i, new Node{2 ,new Node{3,nullPtr}}};

Node m{*n};

Node *np = new Node{*n};
```

```c++
Node::Node(const Node &other):
  data{other.data},
  next{other.next ? new Node{*other next} : nullPtr}{} //recursively copy the node until nullPtr is reached by making a new node
```

Places where a copy ctor is used

1. Creating an object as a copy of another
2. Pass by value
3. Return by value

Cannot create a constructor that passes by value, as to make the argument we would need to use the copy constructor, thus we pass by reference.

---

Note on ctors with one parameter

```c++
Node::Node(int data): data{data}, next {nullptr}{}

Node n{4}; One parameter ctors

Node n = 4; //one param ctors create implitic/automatic conversions
```

```c++
void foo(Node n) {}

foo(4);

string str = "hello"; // same as how we defined the node, this is legal because the string class has a one param constructor
```
To prevent automatic conversions, use the `explicit` ketword

```c++
  struct Node{
    explicit Node (int data);
  }
```

## Destructor

A destructor(dtor) is called when an object is destroyed;

Stack alloc object -> out of scope

heap alloc object -> delete called on a ptr to an object

**Steps for object destruction**

1. Dtor body runs
2. Fields that are object are destroyed in reverse declaration order
3. Space deallocation

The free dtor has an empty dtor body
- sometimes this is not sufficient

np     ->  [1 | -]-> [2 | -]-> [3 | null]
stack      heap

```c++
  delete np;
  //This will simply deallocate the object that np is pointing to, in this case it deallocated one, and we leak 2 and 3
```

```c++
  struct Node{
    ~Node(); //no overloadingm only one destructor
  };

  Node::~Node(){
    delete next;
  }
```

Copy assignment operator
```c++
  Student billy{80,50,75};
  Student bobby{billy}; //Copy constructor is called
  Student jane;
  jane = billy; //Copy assignment operator is called to update and existing object to become a copy
  jane.operator=(billy)
```

```c++
a=b=c=0;
//Assignment is right associative

n1 = n2 = n3;

n1.operator = (n2.operator= (n3))
//This means we should return a node
```
```c++

Node & Node::operator=(const Node &other){
    2. // (See notes) if (this == &other) return *this;
    data = other.data;
    1. // (See Notes) delete next;
    next = other.next ? new Node{* other.next} : nullptr;
    return *this;
}
```

```c++
 Node *n1 = ...
 Node *n2 = ...
 n1 = n2;
 *n1 = *n2; // copy assignment operator
 //This is a self assignment
 //We have implied
 *this = other
```
Notes:
1. Since we are updating an existing object, next could be pointing to heap memory.
2. *other.next is dereferencing a dangling ptr.

```c++
node &Node::operator==(const Node &other){
  if (this == &other) return *this;
  Node *tmp = next;
  next = others.next ? new Node(...) : nullptr; //If this fails nothing after is executed
  date = other.data;
  delete tmp;
  return *this;
}
```

**Copy and Swap Idiom**
```c++
  struct Node {
    void swap(Node &other);
  };

  #include <utility>

  void Node::swap(Node &other){
    using std::swap;
    swap(data,other.data);
    swap(next, other.next);
  }

  Node &Node::operator = (const Node &&other){
    Node tmp = {other}; //deep copy
    swap(tmp);
    return *this; //relies on correct dtor
  }
```
