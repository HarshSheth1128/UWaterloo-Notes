# Lecture 16

# Method overriding

```c++
class Book{
  public
  bool isHeavy() const {...}
};

bool Text::isHeavy() const{...}
bool Comic::isHeavy() const{...}

Book b = Comic {..., ..., 40, ...};

b.isHeavy(); //Book::isHeavy runs
```
//Refer to object slicing pic
When you put subclass object in a superclass object the extra subclass methods are sliced off.

```c++
Comic c{..., ..., 40, ...}

Comic *cp{&c};

cp->isHeavy(); //Comic::isHeavy runs

Book *bp{&cp};

bp->isHeavy(); //no object slicing has occured
//Book::isHeavy still runs
```

Compiler looks at the declared type of the ptr to decide which method to call

- Static Dispatch

Dynamic Dispatch using the "virtual" keyword

```c++
class Book{
public:
  virtual bool isHeavy() const {...}
};

bool Text::isHeavy() const override {...};
bool Comic::isHeavy() const override {...};
```

# Dynamic Dispatch
When the method is called it is based on the runtime type of the object

```c++
Comic c{..., ..., 40};
Comic *cp{&c};
Book *bp{&c};
Book &rb{c};
```

Dynamic Dispatch/virtual does have a runtime cost

```c++
Book *collection[20]; //Polymorphic array

for(int i = 0; i < 20; ++i){
  cout << collection[i]->isHeavy();
}
```

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism : the ability to accomodate multiple types under the same abstraction

Ex.
```c++
ostream &operator<<(ostream &, const MyClass&); //ostream is a polymorphic parameter
```

# Destructors for objects of derived classes

1. Subclass destructor body runs
2. Subclass fields are destroyed (reverse declaration order)
3. Superclass part of object is destroyed
4. Space deallocated

c++/inheritance/example5

```c++
class X{
  int *x;
public:
  X(int n): x{new int[n]}{}
  virtual ~X(){delete[] x;}
};

class Y: public X{
  int *y;
public:
  Y(int n, int m): X(n), y{new int[m]}{}
  ~Y(){delete [] y;}
};

int main(){
  X *myX = new Y{10,20};
  delete myX; //X's dtor called Y's dtor never called
  //We make the destructor virtual to fix this
}
```

A class that expects to have subclasses should declare its dtor virtual as the subclasses will call the superclass dtor after the subclass dtor has run

A class that should not have subclasses should be declared final

```c++
class Y final::public X{
  int final; //this is legal. final works as a keyword if it comes after the method name
  //Otherwise it can be overrided to be a var name. Same with override keyword/
}
```


```c++
class Student{
public:
  virtual int fees();
};

class coop: public Student{
public:
  int fees() override {...}
};

class regular: public Student{
public:
  int fees() override{...}
}
```

Notice:there is no implementation of the fees method in the Student class because its implementation can only be defined if the student is regular or coop. So we do not want Student::fees to have an implementation.
  - declare this method Pure Virtual(P.V)

```c++
class Student {
public:
  virtual int fees() = 0; //Pure virtual method
};
```
A subclass must implement inherited P.V. method to be considered concrete

Student class is an abstract class.

- Cannot create objects of abstract classses
`Student s {...}`

Abstract classes are used for
- organizing types
- share common fields/methods
- polymorphism

```c++
Student *cs246;
```

A subclass of an abstract class must override all inherited P.V methods and not declare any new P.V methods to be considered concrete

C++ Template
```c++
class Stack{
  int *content;
  int capacity;
  int size;
public:
  void push(int);
  int pop();
  int top();
  ~Stack();
};
```

```c++
Template <typename T>
class Stack{
  T *content;
  int capacity;
  int size;
public:
  void push(int);
  T pop();
  T top();
  ~Stack();
};
```

A Template class is a class parameterised on a type

`Stack<int> s;`  
`Stack<string> s;`
