# Lecture 15: Composition/Aggregation/Inheritance

**Last Time**

A composition relationship creates an OWNS-A relation

# Aggregation

Catalog of Car parts
Catalog HAS-A parts

Typically, a class A **HAS-A** relatinship with class B
- if A is copied, B is not copied (shallow copy)
- if A is destroyed, B is not

```c++
class Catalog{
  Part * parts[10]; //ptrs to car parts since parts are not destroyed with catalog it is a **OWNS-A** relatinship
};
```

# Inheritance
These classes do not capture the relation between these
- eg. How do you create an array for Classes all types of books?

In C, union type

Observe: text **IS-A** book, with an extra topic field

`c++/inheritance/example1`

```c++
class Book{
  string title, author;
  int numPages;
public:
  Book(string title, string authorm int numPages): title{title}, author{author}, numPages{numPages}{}
};

class Text: public Book{
  string topic;
};
```

A derived class inherits members from the base class

Any method that can be called on a Book object can be called on a Text/Comic object.

Note: istringstream/ifstream IS-A istream

**Private Members**
A text inherits all members(include private members)

```c++
int main(){
  Text t = ...
  t.author = ... //author is private
}

Text::Text(string title, string author, int numPages, string topic): title{title}, author{author}, numPages{numPages, topic{topic}{}
```

Wont compile
1. inhertied fields are private
2. we can only use fields declared in the class in the MIL
3. Because creating a text tries to default construct the Book part of the object (no Default ctor for Book)

Steps for object construction
1. space is allocated
2. construct the superclass partsfield initialization //MIL
3. field initialization //MIL
4. ctor body

```c++
Text::Text(string t, string a, int n, string topic) : Book(t,a,n), topic {topic}{}
```
# Protected access

```c++
class Book{
protected: //The class or subclasses can access this field
  string author;
};

class Text: public Book{
public:
  void addAuthor(string auth){
    author += auth;
  }
};

int main(){
  Text t = ...
  t.author = x
}
```

In UML

- use # for protected

Private > Protected
- Protected breaks encapsulation (like friend)
- Superclass's job to protect invariants

Advice: keep fields private, provide protected
```c++
class Book{
  string author;
protected:
  void addAuthor(string){[invariant check] author += auth }
};
```

# Method Overriding
Method: isHeavy
Book > 200
Text > 300

c++/inheritance/example2
```c++
class Book{
  int numPages;
public:
  int getNumPages() const {
    return numPages;
  }
  bool isHeavy() const;
};

bool Book::isHeavy() const {return numPages > 200;}

bool Comic::isHeavy() const { }
```

```c++
Book b{... , ..., 100};
b.isHeavy(); //Book::isHeavy runs, false

Comic c{..., ..., 40, "Batman"};
c.isHeavy(); //Comic::isHeavy runs, true

Book b = Comic{... , ... , 40, "Batman"};
b.isHeavy(); //Books::isHeavy is called
```
