#Lecture 14

```c++
List lst;
...
for(auto it = lst begin(); it != lst end(); ++i){
  cout << *it << endl;
}
```

```c++
auto x = y; //x is defined to be the same type as y
```

C++ supports the iterator design pattern

#Range-based for loop
```c++
for(auto n: list){
  cout << n << endl;
}
```

n is a dy value declaration => type : int

```c++
for(auto &n: lst){
  ++n;
}
```

You can use a range-based for loop for a class MyClass if
- MyClass implements `begin()` or `end()` methods that return iterator objects
- That iterator supports `operator*` `operator++` `operator!=`

# Keyword:Friend

ctor for List:Iterator is public
- `begin()` and `end()` from list class can call it.

We would like List::Iterator ctor to be private
- but then `begin` and `end` would lose their access

List::Iterator can declare list to be a friend

```c++
class List{
public:
  class Iterator{
    Node * curr;
    Iterator (Node * curr) ...
  public:
    friend class List;
  };
};
```

Advice: makea a few friends as possible
- breaks encapsulation

# Accessors of Mutators
Past adivce: fields should be private. If we do want ot provide access, use accessors/getters and mutators/setters

```c++
class Vec{
  int x,y;
public:
  int getX() const {return x;}
  int getY() const {return y;}
  void setX(int x){this->x = x;}
  void setY(int y){this->y = y;}
}
```

```c++
class Vec{
  int x,y;
public:
  //no accessors available
  //thus we add
  friend ostream& operator<<(ostream &, const Vec &);
};

ostream &operator<<(ostream &out; const Vec& v){
  out << v.x << v.y;
  return out;
}
```

# Keyword:Mutable
```c++
struct Student{
  int assns, mt, final;
  // orignal: int numCalls = 0;
  // However we want to modify this and keep the rest const
  mutable int numCalls = 0;
  float grade() const{
    ++nulCalls;
    return ...;
  }
};
```

We can change the value of a mutable field for const objects

# Keyword:Static

Static fields are associated with the class and not objects of the class

```c++
//Student.h
struct Student{
  static int numObjs;

  Student(){
    ++numObjs;
    //C++ rule: static fields must be defined in an external file
  }
}

//Student.cc
int Student::numObjs = 0;
```
---
```c++
struct Student{
 ...
 static void printNumObjs(){ coust << numObjs;}
 //Static Member Function(s.m.f)
};
```
We do not need an object to call s.m.f
`Student::printNumObjs();`
you do not have any `this` ptr

---

# System Modelling
- Determine key abstractions(classes)
- Relationship between classes

## Relationship 1: Composition
```c++
class Vec{
  int x; y;
public:
  Vec(int, int);
}

class Basis{
  Vec v1, v2;
  Basis(): v1{0,0}, v2{1,1}{}
}
```

Embedding an object within another is called composition

- create an owns-A relationship
```
Basis       owns-A Vec
Car         owns-A Part
```

Typically, A owns-A B if
- B cannot exist on its own
- A is copied, B is copied(deep)

-if A is destroyed, B is destroyed

List Owns-A Node
