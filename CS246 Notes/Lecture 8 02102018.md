# Lecture 8

## Last time

```c++
Node *np = new Node;
delete np;

int *arr = new int[]
delete [] arr;
```

```c++
//To avoid doing this and making a copy
Node getANode(){
  Node n;
  return n;
}

//Some students do this
Node *getAnode(){
  Node n;
  return &n;
}

//The pointer is stack allocated, after the function
//is popped the pointer is not ours to use anymore
```

This is called a Dangling Pointer, pointing to a memory addr not ours to access

Never return a pointer/reference to data the function allocated on the stack

```c++
//Instead we can allocate on the heap

Node *getANode(){
  Node *np = new Node{...};
  return np;
}
```
## Operator Overloading

Idea: we can give meaning to c++ operators for user-defined types

struct vec{
  int x;
  int y;
};

We can always write a function to do this
```c++
Vec v = add(a, b);

//But we would rather do this
Vec v = a + b;
```
This can be done by overloading the operator

```c++
Vec operator+(const Vec &v1, const vec &v2){
  Vec v{v1.x + v2.x , v1.y + v2.y};
  return v;
}
```

We can also do multiplication (eg. 3*v1)

```c++
Vec operator*(const int k, const Vec &v2){
  return {k*v1.x, k*v1.y};
  //C++ is smart enough to realize you are supplying two args and two args
  //are needed to make a vec, same outcome as the example above
}
```

Notice that we only wrote a function to take in constant * vector. If we tried to do vector * constant it would not work. We can solve this by writing another function

```c++
Vec operator*(const Vec &v1, const int k){
  return k*v1;
  //We can reuse code
}
```

Say we had a struct grade

```c++
struct Grade{
  int theGrade;
}
```

We want to  be able to output a struct;
```c++
Grade g = ...;
cout << g << endl;
```
We can do this by overloading `<<`

```c++
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const Grade&g){
  out << g.theGrade << "%";
  return out;
}
```
Lets say now we want to take a grade via cin

```c++
Grade g;
cin >> g;
cout << g;
```
We can overload `>>`

```c++
istream &operator>>(istream &in, Grade &g){
  in >> g.theGrade;
  if(g.theGrade < 0) g.theGrade = 0;
  if(g.theGrade > 100) g.theGrade = 100;
  return in;
}
```

## C/C++ preprocessor

- A program that runs before the compiler gets the code
- Can change the code
- `#` -> preprocessor directive
  - `#include <'standard library files'>` -> copy and paste this file
  - `#include "'look in current directory'"` -> copy and paste the file

To only run the preprocessor we can use

```bash
g++14 -E -P
```

```bash
#define VAR VALUE
```
will replace all occurences of VAR with VALUE

#defines are used for conditional compilation

Suppose we want "Security Levels 1 & 2"

For 1 we use a "short in"
For 2 we use a "long long int"

```c++
#define SECLEVEL 1

#if SECLEVEL == 1
short int
#elif SECLEVEL == 2
long long int
#endif
publickey
```

will send either

```c++
int main(){



  long long int

  publicKey;
}
```
or

```c++
int main(){

  short int



  publicKey;
}
```
Depending on the sec level.

This requires manually changing the #define for SECLEVEL. To avoid this we can define preprocessor variables from the command line

```bash
g++ -E -P -DSECURITYLEVEL=1 preproccess.cc
```


```
#define ever ;;
for(ever){

}
```

We can run specific sequences of code by using ifdef

```
#define VAR
 - value is empty string

#ifdef VAR true if VAR is defined
#ifndef VAR  true if VAR is not defined
```

File: c++/preprocess/debug.cc

```c++
int main(){
  #ifdef DEBUG
   cout << "this is a debug statement" << endl;
  #endif
}
```
To print this statement we can run

```bash
g++ -DDEBUG debug.cc
```

## Separate compilation

**Interface (.h file)**
- Type definitions + function declarations

**Implementation (.cc files)**
- function implementations

How to compile
1. g++ *.cc
2. g++ main.cc vec.cc

Header files are never compiled
