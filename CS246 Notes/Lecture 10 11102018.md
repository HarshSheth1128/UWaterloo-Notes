# Lecture 10

Last time
```c++
struct Student {
  int assns, mt, final;
  float grade();
  Student(int assns, int mt, int final);
  //same name as class and no return type
};

float Student::grade(){

}

//Below is c-style initialization
Student billy{80,50,75};
//When an appropriate constructor is available, it is called.
//Otherwise default to c-style initialization
billy.grade();
```

New keyword constructs on the heap, otherwise it is on the stack

**Class constructor **
```c++
Student::Student(int assns, int mt, int final){
  this -> assns = assns;
  this -> mt = mt;
  this -> final = final;
}
```

```c++
Student *pBilly = new Student{80,50,70};

delete pBilly;
```

Advantages to using ctors(constructors)
- write arbitrary code in the ctos body
- Write sanity checks
- Default arguments
- Overloading

```c++
//.h file
struct Student{
  Student(int assns = 0; int mt = 0; int final = 0);
}

//.cc file
Student::Student(int assns, int mt, int final){
  this -> assns = assns < 0 ? 0 : assns;
  this -> mt = mt < 0 ? 0 : mt;
  this -> final = final < 0 ? 0 : final;
}
```

Ex
```c++
Student billy{80,50,75}
Student s1{80,50};
Student s2{80};
Student s3;
```

Every class comes with a default ctor(o parameter)
- calls default ctors on fields that are objects

Ex:

```c++
  struct A {
    int x;
    Student y;
    Vec *z;
  };

  then

  A myA; //calls default ctor with 0 parameters

  //Calls constructor on Student, x and z are not initialized
```

As soon as you write and ctor for a class you lose the default ctor of c-style initialization. If you create a constructor for A but nothing exists for x then you get an unititalized student.

```c++
struct Vec{
  int x = 0, y = 0; // Default values for x and y

  //Unless required on an exam we can do this
  Vec(int x, int y){
    this -> x = x;
    this -> y = y;
  }
}
```

## Fields that are contstants/references

**Option 1**

This creates the same constant for every single object
```c++
int m;
struct MyStruct{
  const int myConst = 10;
  int &myRef = m;
}
```
What if we want each student to have a constant that is unique

Can't do it in the ctor body
- field construction should occur earlier

```c++
struct Student {
  const int id = 20233118; // every student gets this id
}
```

Steps for Object construction
1. Allocate space
2. Fields that are objects are initialized (default constructors for fields)
3. Ctor body runs

**Hijack step 2** using a member initialization list

```c++
Student::Student(const int id, int assns, int mt, int final) : id{id}, assns{assns}, mt{mt}, final{final}{}

//Don't need this as the compiler knows that is is referring to a field
```

MIL is special syntax available to ctors
- can be used to initialize any field
- no need to use "this" for disambiguation of fields/params with the same name
- fields in an MIL are initialized in delcaration order
- using the MIL to initialize fields "can be" more efficient than initialization in the ctor body

```c++
Student billy{80,50,75};
Student bobby{billy}; //copy constructor, copies billy
```

You get one for references

Every class comes with
1. default ctor
2. copy ctor
3. copy assignment operator
4. destructor
5. move ctor
6. move assignment

//2-5 are known as the big 5

```c++
Student::Student(const Student &others) : assns {other.assns}, mt{other.mt}, final{other.final}{}
```

Sometimes we don't want the behaviour implemented by the free copy ctor

```c++
struct Node{
  int data;
  Node *next;
  Node(int datem Node *next);
  Node(const Node &other);
};

Node::Node(int data, Node *next) : data{data}, next{next}{}

Node::Node(const Node &other): data{other data}, next{others.next}{}

Node *np = new Node{1, new Node{2, new Node{3, nullptr}}};

Node m{*np}; //copy ctor

Node *n1 = new Node{*np}; //copy ctor, this is a shallow copy as the head of the linked list is chared


```
