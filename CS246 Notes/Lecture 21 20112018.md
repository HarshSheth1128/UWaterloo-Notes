# Lecture 21: Compilation Dependencies, Exception Safety (maybe?)

Last time:

## Visitor Design Pattern
Files: se/visitor

has a cyclic include
- wont compile

An include creates a compilation dependency.
- changes to included files requires the file to recompile
- often a forward declaration of a class is all we need (rather than the include)

`class xyz;`

Whenever possible, prefer forward declarations to includes.
- reduces compilation dependencies (including circular dependencies)
- reduce compile time
- reduces compile frequency

File: a.h
```c++
class A{...}
```

File b.h
```c++
#include "a.h" //need this as compiler needs to know class B but to know class B we need to know class A
//Think that it needs to know sizeof B but before that it needs to know size of A
class B : public A{

};
```

File c.h
```c++
#include "a.h" //need this as compiler needs to know class C but to know class C we need to know class A
//Can't just use a forward declaration
class C {
    A a;
};
```

File d.h
```c++
//Here we need to know size of class D, but all pointers are the same size, so we can just promise that A exists
class A;
class D{
    A *myA; //all ptrs are the same size
}
```

File d.cc
```c++
//Now the compiler needs to see if the method exists, therefore it needs to include the file
#include "a.h"
void D::foo(){
    myA->someMethod();
}
```

File e.h
```c++
//Compiler doesn't need to know what's in A, it just knows we take in an A and return an A
class A;
class E{
    A f(A x);
};
```

File e.cc
```c++
#include "a.h"
A E::f(A x){...};
```

se/visitor2 is a correct implementation of the visitor design pattern

## Reducing Compilation Dependencies
File window.h
```c++
#include <xlib/x11.h>
class XWindow{
    Display *d;
    Window w;
    public:
        draw();
}
```
File: client.cc
```c++
#include "window.h"
myXWindow->draw()
```

File: client.cc has to recompile even if private members in window.h change

Solution: Pointer to implementation (pImpl idiom)
- Take the private implementation out of window.h

File: XWindowImpl.h
```c++
#include <Xlib/X11.h>
struct XWindowImpl{
    Display *d;
    Window w;
}
```

File: window.h
```c++
struct XWindowImpl;
class XWindow{
    XWindowImpl *pImpl;
    public:
        draw();
};
```

File: window.cc
```c++
#include XWindowImpl.h
#include window.h

XWindow::XWindow():
    pImpl{new XWindowImpl}{}
    pImpl->d
```

If private implementation changes, window.h and client.cc are not affected

## Generalization: Bridge Pattern
//UML in pics

## Coupling of Cohesion
Coupling: degree to which modules/classes interact with each other
- low coupling: interaction through a public interface
- high coupling: interaction through a public implementation (friends, public fields)
  
Goal: low coupling

Cohesion: how related are things withing a module
- low cohesion: loosely connected (`<utililty>` header, `<algorithm>` header)
- high cohesion: a module/class does/achieves exactly 1 task

Goal: high cohesion

## Decoupling the interface 
```c++
class ChessBoard{
    cout << "Your move";
};
```

ChessBoard is couples with stdout

Slightly better: use an ofstream variable

```c++
class ChessBoard{
    ostream &out;
    out << "Your move";
};
```
Chessboard class has 2 responsibilities: game state, communication

## Single Responsibility principle
a class should only have one reason to change
Chessboard should not be responsible for communication 
- separate communication class

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) design Pattern

//UML in pics


## Exception safety
```c++
void f(){
    Myclass *p = new MyClass();
    Myclass c;
    g();
    delete p;
    //If g throws an exception, p leaks
}
```
