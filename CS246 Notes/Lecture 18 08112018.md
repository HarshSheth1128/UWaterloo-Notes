# Lecture 18 Exceptions/Design Patterns

Last time
In c++, we can throw anything
```c++
try{
  ....
} catch (...){
  //catch anything
}
```

Good practice: use existing exception classes or create your own.


```c++
class BadInput{};

int n;
try {
  if(!(cin >> n)) throw BadInput{}
} catch(BadInput &){n = 0;}
```

Advice: catch exceptions by reference.
- Avoids copying
- Avoids object slicing

# Exceptions of destructors

By default, if an exception occurs in a destructor, std::terminate is called and the program stops.

```c++
~Class() noexcept(false){...}
```

Suppose there is an exception, and the stack is unwinding
- dtors of stack-allocated objects are being called
- what is the dtor throws an exception
- we have 2 unhandles/uncaught exceptions
  - std::terminate is called

Advice: do not let dtors throw exceptions

# Design Patterns
Guiding Principle: Program to an interface, not implementation.
  - Create an abstract base class to provide the interface
  - Use ptrs to base class to call the interface methods
  - Subclass objects can be swapped in and out

## Revisit Iterator Design Pattern:

```c++
class AbsIter{
public:
  virtual int &operator*() const = 0;
  virtual AbsIter &operator++() = 0;
  virtual bool operator != (const AbsIter &) const = 0;
  virtual ~AbsIter(){};
};

class List{
  ...
public:
  class Iterator : public AbsIter{
    ...
  public:
    int &operator*() const override{...}
    Iterator &operator++() override {}
    bool operator!=(const AbsIter &) override {..}
  };
};

class Set{
  ...
public:
  class Iterator : public AbsIter{
    ...
  };
};

List::Iterator IS-A AbsIter

Set::Iterator IS-A AbsIter
```

We are no longer tied t oa particular data structure template `<typename Fn>`

```c++
void foreach(AbsIter &start, const AbsIter &end, Fn f){
  while (start != end){
    f(*start);
    ++start;
  }
}

List l;
list::Iterator begin = l.begin();
void addFive(int &n){n=n+5}
foreach(begin,l.end(),addFive);
```

## Observer Pattern
- used for a publish/subscribe system

Subject: Generates data
Observer: subscribes to data

If you want a class to be abstract, but there isn't any P.V method, make the dtor P.V
- but still give an implementation

Real definition of a pure virtual method: A p.v method must be implemented by the subclass for it to be concrete.

## Decorator
Used to update/decorate already created objects
