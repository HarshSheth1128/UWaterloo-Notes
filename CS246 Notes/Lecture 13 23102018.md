# Lecture 12: Invariants of Encapuslation

```c++
struct Node{
  ~Node(){delete next}
};

Node n1{1, new Node{2, nullptr}};

Node n2{3 &n1} //crashes as &n1 is a stack address
```

Class Node assumed that next was either nullptr or points to the heap

Invariant: statment/assumptions that must be true for our class/code to behave as intended.

Program correctness requires us to be able to guarantee invariants

# Encapuslation
- objects are treated as capsules/black boxes
- implementation is hidden
- Client code interacts with the class through a provided interface

```c++
struct Vec {
  Vec(int x, int y);
private:
  int x,y //hidden outside the class

public:
  Vec operator+(const Vec &other){
    return {x+other.x, y+other.y};
  }
}
```

Advice: always make fields private
```c++
  Vec v{1,2}; //default visibility in struct is public
  Vec v1 = v+v;
  cout << v.x << v.y; //fields are private
```

A class created using the "class" keyword has by default private visibility

```c++
class Vec{
  int x,y;
public:
  Vec(int x, int y);
  Vec operator+(const Vec&);
}
```

# Node Invariant
- disallow client code from creating nodes
- prevent client code from accessing "next"

Create a wrapper class around NOde which ahs sole access to Nodes

//list
```c++
class List{
  struct Node; //private nested
  Node *thelist = nullptr;
  public:
  void addToFron(int);
  int ith(int);
  ~List();
};
```

```c++
//List.cc
struct List::Node{
  int data;
  Node*next;
  ~Node(){delete next;}
}

void List:~List(){
  delete theList;
}

void List::addToFront(int i){
  theList = new Node{i, theList};
}

int List::ith(int i){
  //precondition ith Node exists
  Node *curr = thelist;
  for(int j = 0; j < i && curr; ++j, curr = curr->next);
  return curr->data;
}
```

How would you traverse this list?

O(n2)

We want O(n) traverse?

# Design Pattern
Iterator Design Pattern

Idea: we want to keep track where we are in the list traversal

- Create a class whose job it is to keep track of where we are within the list traversal
- This itertor calss will act as an abstraction of a pointer inside our list

```c++
//arr is an array
for ( int *p = arr; p != arr+arraySize; ++p){
}
```

ToDo:
- operator !=, operator++ (unary + not addition binary operator), operator*(unary star for dereferencing not binary mult operator)
- Begin - create Iterator at start of list
- End - create Iterator to indicate end

```c++
class List{
  struct Node;
  Node *theList = nullptr;
public:
  class Iterator{
    Node *curr;
  public:

    Iteator (Node *curr):
      curr{curre}{}

    int opeator*()const{
      return curr->data;
    }

    Iterator &operator++(){
			curr = curr->next;
			return *this;
		}

    bool operator!=(const Iterator &other){
			return curr != other.curr;
		}

  };//end Iterator class

  //Within List class
  Iteration begin(){ return Iterator {thelist}; }
  Iterator end(){ return Iterator{nullptr}; }
};
```

```c++
List lst;
lst.addToFront(1);
lst.addToFront(2);
lst.addToFront(3);

for(List::Iterator it=lst.begin(); it != lst.end(); ++it){ 	//not it++ cuz then you need to implement another
	*it = *it + 1;
}

for (auto n : lst){
	n
}
```
