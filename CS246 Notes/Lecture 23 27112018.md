# Lecture 23 Exception Safety/Casting

Last time
3 Levels of exception safety
- Basic
- String
- No throw

We need to analyze code line by line to determine the exception safety level

Strong guarantee: if the function throws an error, it is as if it never occured

```cpp
class A {};
class B {};
class C {
	A a;
	B b;
	void f(){
		a.method1(); //strong guarantee
		b.method2(); //strong gurarantee
	}
};
```

If method 1 throw, f has a strong guarantee
If method 2 throws, we need to undo what method 1 did
- often undos are not possible
-> f() does not have a strong guarantee

Suppose method1/method2 only have local side effects.
Can we rewrite f to provide a strong guarantee

```cpp
void C::f(){
	A atemp{a};
	B btemp{b};
	atemp.method1();
	btemp.method2();
	a = atemp;
	b = btemp; //if B::operator= throws, we do not have a strong gurarntee
	//f would have a strong guarantee if B::operator= does not throw
}
```

```cpp
struct CImpl{A a; B b};
class C{
	unique_ptr<CImp> pImpl;
	void f(){
		unique_ptr<CImpl> temp(new CImpl(*pImpl));
	}
	//auto temp = make_uniqeu<cImpl> (*pImpl);
	temp->a.method1();
	temp->b.method2();
	std::swap(pImpl,temp);
}
```

Eception safety in the STL
vector - uses RAII
	   - wraps around a heap array
	   - alloc deallocates array

```cpp
void f(){
	vector<MyClass> v;
	//When v is destroyed, the elements (objects) are also destroyed
}

void g(){
	vector <MyClass *> v;
}

//WHen v goes out of scope the elements withng the array (ptrs) are not deleted

void g(){
	vector(MyClass *) v;
	for(auto p:v) delete p;
}

void h(){
	vector <unique_ptr<MyClass>> v;
}
```

std::vector::emplace-back provides a strong guarantee

Easy case: size < capcity
- add element to end

Harder case: size == capacity

//Inefficient
create layer array
- copy from old to new
swap old and new ptrs
delete old ___ no throw

More efficient would be to move elements to the new array.
- if an exception occurs during the move, we lose strong guarantee

Emplace_back uses the move operations if those operatoions are "noexcept", otherwise copies are used.

## Casting
```cpp
//C style cast
Node n;
int *p = (int *)&n;
```

## 4 kinds of c++ casts
1. static-cast
- a "sensible" cast where the type conversion is well defined

```cpp
void f(int);
void f(double);

double a = ...;
//f(a) call f(double)

f(static_cast<int>(a)); calls f(int)
```

Book *bp = new Text{};
to call getTopic, we need a Text *
  

```cpp
Text *tp = static_cast<Text *>(bp);
```
- There must be an IS-A relaitonship between the current type of the requested type
- Downcast //unchecked cast
	- if your assumption is not correct behaviour is undefined

2. reinterpreted_cast
	- anything goes
	- relies on compiler-dependent decisions on how objects appear in memoy

```c++
Student &s = ____
Turtle *t = reinterpret_cast<Student *>(s);
t->draw();
```

`reinterpret.cc`
- relies on compiler assigning pointers to vars first and then methods. Else C would ened to have the same methods as the rougec
- as of now, to the compiler, C and RougeC look the same till x is assigned a value. Up till that point its consistent

3. const_cast
Used to remove "const"
```c++
void g(int *p);
const int *q = ____;
g(q); //wont compile
g(const_cast<int *>(q)); //will compile
```
DisAdv: if g changes p. then it wont work
